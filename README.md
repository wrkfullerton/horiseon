# Horiseon Social Solutions Services Inc. 

The following User Story and Acceptance Criteria was met by going through the HTML and the CSS of the Horiseon Social Solution Services Inc webpage and optimzing it for SEO and future sustainability. 

In order to optimize the code base for SEO and future sustainability - we utilized semantic HTML elements. Whether that was with <header>, <section>, or <footer> elements and changed all of the related CSS. 

We also spent some time optimizing and consolidating the CSS selectors and properties, and organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements. We also included comments before each element/section of the page.
